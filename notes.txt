 synthete analysis is closest to is a form of nearest-neighbor benchmarking with stratified banding:

k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Regression/Matching:

Nonparametric Counterfactual/Peer Benchmarking: This approach is widely used in policy analysis to compare a focal unit against an empirical distribution or a hand-picked/synthetically weighted group of similar units, but your algorithm is deterministic and based on fully observable GDP ranks.


Empirical Growth Band Estimation: The construction of 'upper' and 'lower' bands is analogous to calculating percentile-based boundaries or prediction intervals among nearby observations.

Here's what the analyses are telling us:
1. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares):
Finds the best (linear) fit between how much a country overshoots/undershoots its synthete primary balance target (x-axis: actual-synthete) and how much it overshoots/undershoots the synthete-predicted growth (y-axis: actual-synthete).
The OLS slope is small and negative (-0.0016), and the R² is very low (0.04). This means:
Countries with tighter-than-expected fiscal stances (higher pb_final than their peer target) tend (very slightly) to underperform on growth relative to their peer expectation, but the effect is essentially negligible.
Primary balance deviations explain almost none of the difference in growth deviations across countries, after controlling for peer context.
2. Huber RLM (Robust Linear Model):
Robust regression (less sensitive to outliers) using the Huber loss confirms the OLS pattern:
Slope: -0.0015, nearly identical negativity and magnitude to OLS.
Intercept is also similar. This shows that outliers do NOT drive the OLS result.
3. Theil-Sen Estimator (Nonparametric Robust Slope):
Computes the median slope among all pairwise differences. Again:
Slope: -0.0014, very slightly less negative than OLS, but consistent in direction and magnitude.
Not influenced by outliers; this is the direction that would be found by eye from the central trend.
Interpretation:
All methods agree: there is a tiny, negative slope—so, countries with tighter fiscal stances than their peer target on average have slightly lower growth than the peer mean, but the effect is extremely small and accounts for almost no cross-country variation in growth.
There is no practical evidence that systematically hitting a 'harder' fiscal target leads to (or costs) materially more/faster growth among countries when controlling for peer economic structure and starting point.
This result is robust to outliers and non-linearities (as seen from your earlier quadratic fit, which also didn't reveal strong non-linear association).
Policy insight: The analysis implies that, within structural peer groups (synthete bands), moving fiscal targets tighter or looser by a few percentage points is not associated with big changes in relative growth performance. This suggests that other factors (institutions, shocks, private investment, etc.) are likely much more important drivers of deviations from peer growth expectations.
